    <p style="text-align:justify">Developing websites using the Ruby on Rails framework is very fulfilling for me as a developer, and cost effective to you as a customer.  Rails adds efficiency to the development process from the ground up even when the scope of a project changes.  The framework is agile, convention-driven, widely supported, database-agnostic, and robust. Ruby as a programming language is intuitive and very flexible.  I can get a lot done for you in short order developing with Rails. Does your hosting provider support Rails websites?  It has been my experience that most major hosting providers do. If your provider does not, I can help you find one that does.</p>

    <h4><img style="height:60px" src="/php-logo.jpeg"/> PHP</h4><hr/><p style="text-align:justify">PHP was my first introduction the website development in the early 2000s. Today it is by far the most popular programming language on the Internet and one I have spent a great deal of time in. Like Ruby it is easy to learn and develop with.  PHP drives most of the lift-and-drop frameworks for consumers building websites today.  For many, Wordpress is a very popular choice in this space.  With all of the fancy themes, and plugins, sometimes more is needed to get a Wordpress site just right.  Most of my PHP development work fills this niche.  I can help you make Wordpress do what you need it to do whether that is a custom plugin, or tweaks to some existing functionality. If you are using CakePHP or another platform not a problem, I've written many PHP websites from the ground up.</p>

    <p style="text-align:justify">I would love to spend all of my time developing your website and making it do awesome things for you (believe me I really would), but that will all go to waste unless the world can see it.  This is where I get to use my secret arsenal of weaponry. As it turns out, working in the world of tech for 12 years one gains a broad skill set that can be put to use.  Unlike many developers, I really know my way around the technologies that make the Internet go. I can transfer your domain name and email accounts, build a cloud-based secure Linux hosting environment, scale your site to meet demand, and much more.  I've been on the other side of the fence with all of these technologies and know how they work behind the scenes at your hosting provider.

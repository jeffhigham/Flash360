      <h3>About Flash360 Consulting</h3>
      <blockquote>My career has been a tale of two lives - Software Developer and Systems Engineer.  I love high performance operating systems and hardware, finding solutions to complicated technical problems, and writing good code.  Coding my first PHP website in 2000 was my introduction to the power software and the Internet. We have come a long way since then. We now have beautify frameworks like Ruby on Rails, browsers starting to conform to standards, JQuery, and a host other technologies. The end is no where in site and for me that is exciting.  Please take a moment to see what I've been up to and let me know how I can help.<cite>Jeff Higham - Owner, Flash360 Consulting, LLC</cite>
